Where the only thing thats wet is the soil!
This progect is no longer active as continued on git labs --> https://gitlab.com/britton477/onlyplants-server

A fun project where we are building a website to monitor the health of my friends plants 20 miles away.  
The temp, moisture and humidity will be monitored using an arduino.  
PHP is used for the backend, working with SQL to manage the database.  
HTML and CSS for the front end because duh.  
The server will be hosted using Apache.
